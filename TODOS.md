- [x] Verify unpushed branches (*) and prompt to push them.
- [x] Check if branch is pushed before making PR
        It's annoying if you lose the description
- [ ] Indicate more detailed status for each branch
- [ ] Work from MEGAMERGE, be aware of multiple branch paths
- [ ] Add marker indicating current stack when '--all'
- [ ] Add a 'ref' option to run command from other leaf
- [ ] ~Default reviewers in `.prstack.edn`?
