# prstack feature-base

Manage feature base branches in your repository. Feature base branches act as alternative trunk branches for organizing related work.

## Overview

Feature bases allow you to create stacks of work that branch from a point other than the main trunk. This is useful when:

- Working on a large feature that requires multiple PRs
- Organizing a series of changes that depend on an unmerged feature branch
- Creating experimental branches that should not yet target the main trunk

Once a feature base is configured, PrStack will treat it as a valid stopping point when discovering your stack, similar to how it treats the main trunk branch.

## Stack Visualization

Here's how feature bases enable parallel stacks of work:

```mermaid
gitGraph
  commit id: "Initial"
  commit id: "Setup"
  branch ui-redesign
  commit id: "Base: UI redesign"
  branch redesign-header
  commit id: "Header component"
  commit id: "Header styles"
  checkout ui-redesign
  branch redesign-footer
  commit id: "Footer component"
  commit id: "Footer styles"
  checkout main
  branch api-v2
  commit id: "Base: API v2"
  branch api-auth
  commit id: "Add auth endpoint"
  commit id: "Add JWT logic"
  checkout api-v2
  branch api-users
  commit id: "Add users endpoint"
  commit id: "Add validation"
```

In this example:
- **`ui-redesign`** is a feature base with two PRs: `redesign-header → ui-redesign` and `redesign-footer → ui-redesign`
- **`api-v2`** is another feature base with two PRs: `api-auth → api-v2` and `api-users → api-v2`
- Both feature bases branch from `main` and can be developed in parallel
- Each feature base will eventually have its own PR to merge into `main`

## Subcommands

### `prstack feature-base list`

List all configured feature base branches.

```bash
prstack feature-base list
```

**Example output**:
```
feature-redesign
experimental-api
large-refactor
```

### `prstack feature-base add`

Add a branch as a feature base.

```bash
prstack feature-base add [branch-name]
```

If `branch-name` is not provided, you'll be prompted to select from available local branches.

**Example**:
```bash
prstack feature-base add feature-redesign

# Output:
# ✔ Added feature-redesign as a feature base branch
```

**With interactive selection**:
```bash
prstack feature-base add

# Prompts:
# Select feature base branch
# > feature-redesign
#   experimental-api
#   main
#   develop
```

### `prstack feature-base remove`

Remove a branch from feature bases.

```bash
prstack feature-base remove [branch-name]
```

If `branch-name` is not provided, you'll be prompted to select from configured feature bases.

**Example**:
```bash
prstack feature-base remove feature-redesign

# Output:
# ✔ Removed feature-redesign from feature base branches
```

### `prstack feature-base create`

Create a new feature base branch from the trunk.

```bash
prstack feature-base create <branch-name>
```

This command:
1. Creates a new branch from the current trunk
2. Automatically adds it as a feature base
3. Switches to the new branch

**Example**:
```bash
prstack feature-base create feature-redesign

# Output:
# Creating branch feature-redesign from main...
# ✔ Created and switched to feature-redesign
# ✔ Added feature-redesign as a feature base branch
```

## How It Works

Feature base branches are stored in your local `.prstack/config.edn` file under the `:feature-base-branches` key:

```clojure
{:feature-base-branches #{"feature-redesign" "experimental-api"}
 :ignored-branches #{}}
```

When PrStack discovers your stack, it will stop at any feature base branch, treating it as the "trunk" for that particular stack.

## Example Workflow

Here's a typical workflow using feature bases:

```bash
# Create a feature base for a large redesign
prstack feature-base create ui-redesign

# Create work branches off the feature base
git checkout -b redesign-header ui-redesign
# ... make changes ...
git checkout ui-redesign
git checkout -b redesign-footer ui-redesign
# ... make changes ...

# Discover your stack - it will stop at ui-redesign
prstack list
# Output:
# redesign-footer
# ui-redesign

# Create PRs - redesign-footer will target ui-redesign
prstack create
# Creates PR: redesign-footer → ui-redesign

# Later, when ready to merge the entire feature
prstack feature-base remove ui-redesign
# Now ui-redesign can target main
```

## Use Cases

### Large Feature Development

Break down a large feature into manageable PRs that all build on a common feature base:

```
redesign-footer → ui-redesign
redesign-header → ui-redesign
ui-redesign → main
```

### Experimental Work

Keep experimental branches separate from production:

```
experiment-3 → experiment-2 → experimental-api
experimental-api → main (created later when ready)
```

### Team Collaboration

Multiple developers can work on related changes targeting a shared feature base:

```
alice-auth-ui → auth-feature
bob-auth-api → auth-feature
auth-feature → main
```
