# prstack machete

Exports the current stack to `.git/machete` format for compatibility with Git Machete tools.

## Usage

```bash
prstack machete
```

## What It Does

The `machete` command:

1. Discovers your current stack from your position to trunk
2. Exports the stack structure to `.git/machete` file
3. Makes your stack compatible with [Git Machete](https://github.com/VirtusLab/git-machete) tools

## Example

```bash
prstack machete

# Creates/updates .git/machete with:
# main
#   feature-a
#     feature-c
```

## Use Case

This command is useful when you want to:

- Use Git Machete tools alongside PrStack
- Share your stack structure in a standard format
- Migrate from PrStack to Git Machete
- Integrate with tools that read `.git/machete`

## Difference from Git Machete

While Git Machete requires you to maintain the `.git/machete` file manually, PrStack generates it dynamically based on your current position. You can regenerate it at any time by running `prstack machete` from any branch in your development tree.
