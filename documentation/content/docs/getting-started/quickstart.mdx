# Quickstart

Get started with PrStack in just a few minutes.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- [Babashka](https://babashka.org/) installed
- [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) installed and authenticated
- A Git or Jujutsu repository

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yannvanhalewyn/prstack.git
cd prstack

# Make executable
chmod +x bin/prstack

# Add to PATH or create symlink
ln -s $(pwd)/bin/prstack /usr/local/bin/prstack
```

## Your First Stack

Let's create a simple PR stack:

```bash
# Navigate to your repository
cd your-repo

# Create first feature branch (using Jujutsu)
jj new -m "Add user authentication"
jj bookmark create feature-auth

# Create second feature branch based on the first
jj new -m "Add user profile page"
jj bookmark create feature-profile

# Sync your stack
prstack sync
```

PrStack will:
1. Discover your stack: `feature-profile → feature-auth → main`
2. Offer to create PRs for both branches
3. Set up the correct base branches automatically
