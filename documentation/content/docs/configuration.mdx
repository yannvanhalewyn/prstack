# Configuration

PrStack can be configured using a `.prstack/config.edn` file in your repository root.

## Configuration File

Create a `.prstack/config.edn` file in your repository:

```clojure
{:ignored-branches #{"staging" "experimental" "temp-branch"}}
```

## Configuration Options

### `:ignored-branches`

A set of branch names to exclude from stack discovery and operations. This is useful for filtering out temporary, experimental, or staging branches that shouldn't be part of your PR workflow.

**Type**: Set of strings  
**Default**: `#{}`

**Example**:
```clojure
{:ignored-branches #{"staging" "experimental" "temp-branch" "wip-*"}}
```

When PrStack discovers your stack, any branches in this set will be skipped and not included in the stack operations.

## Example Configuration

Here's a complete example configuration file:

```clojure
{:ignored-branches #{"staging" "experimental" "temp-*" "wip-*" "backup-*"}}
```

This configuration will exclude any branches named:
- `staging`
- `experimental`
- Any branch starting with `temp-`
- Any branch starting with `wip-`
- Any branch starting with `backup-`
